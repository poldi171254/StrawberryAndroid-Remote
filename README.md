This is a very basic remote for the Strawberry Player
It's taken a long time to write this  as I had to learn Kotlin, Android Studio, etc. I'm sure a guru would write this in a weekend, but what is there works and meets me needs; namely to be able to provide basic control over the Strawberry player remotely

To build this, you will need Android Studio and it should just build
